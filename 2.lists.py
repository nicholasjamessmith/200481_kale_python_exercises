seven = [887, 106, 368, 603, 35, 455, 728, 449, 108, 47]


# 8. Write a program that filters out all elements in a list that are less than a specified value.

nine = [679, 697, 657, 171, 503, 582, 656, 82, 724, 796]


# 10. Write a program that take a list and print a subset of its elements by specifying a start and end index.

start_index = 1
end_index = 4

# 11. Write a program iterates the list and
# prints 'FizzBuzz' when divisable by 3 and 5.  
# prints 'Fizz' when divisable by 3 .  
# prints 'Buzz' when divisable by 5. 
eleven = [213, 927, 265, 39, 860, 421, 550, 884, 991, 1500]



# 12. Write a program that appends an element to the end of a list.
twelve = [36, 632, 155, 350, 746, 642, 113, 534, 9, 34]


# 13. Write a program that inserts an element at a specific position in a list.
thirteen = [191, 871, 990, 163, 687, 747, 606, 799, 373, 851]

# 14. Write a program that counts how many times a specific element appears in a list.
fourteen = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1]
element_to_count = 1

# try using for loop and conditional
# and then try .count() method


# 15.  Write a program that extracts all even numbers from a list and stores them in even_only:
# use for loop and conditionals
fifteen = [267, 688, 88, 755, 680, 746, 559, 710, 283, 451]

# The answer is not sixteen.reverse(). 
sixteen = [378, 763, 856, 566, 847, 795, 313, 540, 67, 219]


# 17. Write a flattens this double nested listbelow:
# Result should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Hint: try a nested loop (2 for in loops) 
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]


# 18. Write a program that finds duplicates from the 2 lists below:
# Hint: try a nested loop (2 for in loops) and use equality
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
